# Welcome To Revolt
## What is Revolt?
Revolt is a 32-bit wide virtual CPU which can take assembly-style code as input. It's written in C++, and can be run out of your compiler of choice and a terminal. 
- Simulates RAM  ( up to 16 GB)
- Decodes to binary and executes said binary
- works in words, not bytes
- 16 general-purpose registers
- console I/O at memory[0] to memory[2]
- registers are typed, RAM isn't.
- has and uses a stack buffer.
- program exits if your assembly FAULTs. 
## Revolt is open to having compilers target it.

## How do I run it?
Download main.cpp, and compile it for your machine. 

Have fun!
